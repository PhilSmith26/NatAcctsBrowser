<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>Canadian National Accounts Browser</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> This is a Canadian national accounts browser. It presents the main 50 tables of Canada's quarterly national accounts, containing 2217 time series. These tables present a remarkably rich and comprehensive picture of the Canadian economy in the postwar period. If you are interested in the economy, you could easily spend hours effortlessly exploring its features by means of the fully up-to-date statistics presented by this browser.<br><br>

Statistics Canada makes the national accounts data available free, online, to anyone who wants to see them. So what is the need for this browser? The need arises because Statistics Canada's online data tables contain only the basic statistics. While the institution provides a lot of its own analysis of these data, it offers no facility to help users manipulate and chart the data themselves. You can of course download one of the national accounts tables and analyze the numbers on your own, using a spreadsheet or some other software, but this can be cumbersome and time-consuming.<br><br>

This browser allows you to explore the national accounts data easily, from a number of different angles. It works best if you have a moderately large computer screen, but it also works fine on my laptop. It easily transforms the basic data by calculating percentage changes, ratios to GDP and other analytical manipulations. It also helps visualize changes in the statistics through time, by means of graphical representations. And it allows you to analyze the corresponding annual statistics, using the same transformation and charting capabilities.<br><br>

Statistics Canada provides the quarterly national accounts in online tables, including both ones that are regularly updated and archived historical tables that are not. This browser deals with forty-seven of the currently updated quarterly tables from this large database and three of the archived historical ones.<br><br>

You are presently reading from the 'Introduction and explanation' tab. There are eight other tabs labelled 'List of tables', 'Quarterly tables', 'Quarterly charts', 'Annual tables', 'Annual charts', 'Quarterly selections 1', 'Quarterly selections 2' and 'Annual selections'. You click them to gain access to their functions. It is straightforward to use these tabs, although a brief explanation follows.<br>

<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>The 'List of tables' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> The 'List of tables' tab enumerates the national accounts tables that can be browsed, in other words the scope of this application. The same list can be found in the quarterly and annual 'tables' and 'charts' tabs when you click in the 'Choose a table:' box. The list also gives the time range covered by each table. The tab has no other functionality.<br>

<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>The 'Quarterly tables' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> The 'Quarterly tables' tab presents the statistics in tabular form, for any one of the tables in the list. The time range to be displayed is selectable. You can choose any of the tables by clicking in the 'Choose a table' box. Choices are also offered among six possible transformations of the data which are:<br><br>
- Original table (no transformation),<br>
- Indexed, starting quarter = 100,<br>
- One-quarter percentage change,<br>
- Four-quarter percentage change,<br>
- Percentage of gross domestic product at market prices,<br>
- Five-quarter centred moving average<br><br>
The "Percentage of gross domestic product at market prices" transformation is available for all tables that do not contain price or volume index numbers. It provides a way to explore the magnitude of different series relative to the GDP yardstick. However, note that it does not always mean "share" since the elements in some tables are not components of gross domestic product. For example, this applies to transfer payments in the revenue, expenditure and budgetary balance tables.<br><br>

You may notice that in some tables, some of the line captions have a number in brackets at the end, such as "Households (2)". This is not a footnote reference. Rather, it is a number inserted to distinguish, within the program, between table rows that contain different statistics, but would otherwise have the same line caption. Thus, for example, in the "Current and capital accounts, National" table, "Households (1)" refers to the part of the national balance of primary incomes that pertains to households, while "Households (2)" refers to the part of national disposable income that pertains to households. In the financial flows and national balance sheet tables the symbols (A) and (L), for "assets" and "liabilities", are used instead of (1) and (2).<br><br>

There is a button on the right, above the display of a table, that can be used to download the table. The downloaded '.csv' file contains the data you see on the screen, covering the time range displayed, so if you choose one of the transformations, the downloaded data will have that transformation.<br>

<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>The 'Quarterly charts' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> The 'Quarterly charts' tab allows you to draw a chart for any one of the time series that is shown in the tables. The time range to be displayed in the chart is selectable, as is the choice of transformation.<br><br>

Similar to the 'Quarterly tables' tab, you begin making a chart by clicking in the 'Choose a table' box to select a table. Then you click in the 'Choose a time series to chart' box to select a time series in that table. The third step is to pick a transformation. Finally, you can select any starting and ending quarters for the chart between the first available quarter and the latest quarter. Note, however, that in some tables Statistics Canada provides data for a shorter time range for certain time series than it does for other series in the table. This explains why the time range in charts for some time series may be shorter than expected.<br><br>

Again, as in the 'Quarterly tables' tab, there are situations where one of the transformations is not applicable, in which case you are informed and no chart is displayed. In addition, there is a button on the right, above the graphical display, that can be used to download the chart that is displayed, as a '.png' file.<br><br>

There is also a box allowing you to specify, at your option, a different title for a chart. This option is provided because the default chart title is the Statistics Canada line caption for the chosen line in the table. These line captions are often not sufficiently descriptive and if you want to download the chart you might prefer to specify a different title.<br>

<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>The two 'Annual' tabs</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> The 'Annual tables' and 'Annual charts' tabs have functions identical to the corresponding 'Quarterly' tabs, but applied to the corresponding annual data. The browser creates the annual data by time-aggregating the quarterly data. When doing so, it drops years for which not all four of the quarters are available.

<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>The three 'Selections' tabs</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> The three selections tabs offer a set of thirty-six charts, drawn by this application. These are static charts and their purpose is to illustrate what you can discover by exploring the fifty tables, choosing a line in a table, applying one of the transformations, selecting an appropriate time range and displaying the results in graphical form.<br>

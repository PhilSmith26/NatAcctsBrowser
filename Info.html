<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>Canadian National Accounts Browser</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> This is a Canadian national accounts browser. It presents the main 48 tables of Canada's quarterly national accounts, containing 2013 time series. The browser works best if you have a moderately large computer screen, but it also works fine on my laptop.<br><br>
Statistics Canada makes the national accounts data available free, online, to anyone who wants to see them. So what is the need for this browser? The need arises because Statistics Canada's online data tables contain only the basic statistics. They provide no facility to transform the data in ways that make them more analytically digestible. You can of course download one of these tables and analyze the numbers yourself, using appropriate software, but this can be cumbersome and time-consuming. <br><br>
This browser allows you to explore the national accounts data easily, from a number of different angles. It does this partly through transformations of the basic data, such as percentage changes and ratios to GDP. It also helps visualize changes in the statistics through time, by means of graphical representations.<br><br>
Statistics Canada provides the quarterly national accounts in online tables, including both ones that are regularly updated and archived historical tables that are not. This browser deals with forty-five of the currently updated quarterly tables from this large database and three of the archived historical ones.<br><br>
You are presently reading from the 'Introduction and explanation' tab. There are five other tabs labelled 'List of tables', Tables', 'Charts', 'Selections 1' and 'Selections 2'. You click them to gain access to their functions. It is straightforward to use these tabs, although a brief explanation follows.<br>
<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>The 'List of tables' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> The 'List of tables' tab enumerates the national accounts tables that can be browsed, in other words the scope of this application. The same list can be found in the 'Tables' and 'Charts' tabs when you click in the 'Choose a table:' box. The list also gives the time range covered by each table. The tab has no other functionality.<br>
<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>The 'Tables' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> The 'Tables' tab presents the statistics in tabular form, for any one of the tables in the list. The time range to be displayed is selectable. You can choose any of the tables by clicking in the 'Choose a table' box. Choices are also offered among five possible transformations of the data which are:<br><br>
- Original table (no transformation),<br>
- Indexed, starting quarter = 100<br>
- One-quarter percentage change,<br>
- Four-quarter percentage change and<br>
- Percentage of gross domestic product at market prices<br><br>
The "Percentage of gross domestic product at market prices" transformation is available for all tables that do not contain price or volume index numbers. It provides a way to explore the magnitude of different series relative to the GDP yardstick. However, note that it does not always mean "share" since the elements in some tables are not components of gross domestic product. For example, this applies to transfer payments in the revenue, expenditure and budgetary balance tables.<br><br>
You may notice that in some tables, some of the line captions have a number in brackets at the end, such as "Households (2)". This is not a footnote reference. Rather, it is a number inserted to distinguish, within the program, between table rows that contain different statistics, but would otherwise have the same line caption. Thus, for example, in the "Current and capital accounts, National" table, "Households (1)" refers to the part of the national balance of primary incomes that pertains to households, while "Households (2)" refers to the part of national disposable income that pertains to households.<br><br>
There is a button on the right, above the display of a table, that can be used to download the table. The downloaded .csv file contains the data and covers the time range displayed, so if you choose one of the transformations, the downloaded data will have that transformation.<br>
<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>The 'Charts' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> The 'Charts' tab allows you to draw a chart for any one of the time series that is shown in the tables. The time range to be displayed in the chart is selectable, as is the choice of transformation.<br><br>
As in the 'Tables' tab, you begin by clicking in the 'Choose a table' box to select a table. Then you click in the 'Choose a time series to chart' box to select a time series in that table. The third step is to pick a transformation, just as in the 'Tables' tab. Finally, you can select any starting and ending quarters for the chart between the first available quarter and the latest quarter. <br><br>
Again, as in the 'Tables' tab, there are situations where one of the transformations is not applicable, in which case you are informed and no chart is displayed. In addition, as again in the 'Tables' tab, there is a button on the right, above the graphical display, that can be used to download the chart that is displayed, as a .png file.<br>
<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>The two 'Selections' tabs</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> The two selections tabs offer a set of twenty-four charts, drawn by this application. These are static charts and they illustrate what you can discover by choosing a line in one of the tables, applying one of the transformations, selecting an appropriate time range and displaying the results in graphical form.<br>

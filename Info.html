<h2 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>Canadian National Accounts Browser</strong></h2>
<h3 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> This is a Canadian national accounts browser. It displays the main 57 tables of Canada's quarterly national accounts, containing 2,637 time series. These tables present a remarkably rich and comprehensive picture of the Canadian economy in the postwar period. If you are interested in the economy, you could spend hours effortlessly exploring its features by means of the fully up-to-date statistics presented by this browser.<br><br>

Statistics Canada makes the national accounts data available free, online, to anyone who wants to see them. So what is the need for this browser? The need arises (for me anyway) because Statistics Canada's online data tables contain only the basic statistics. While the institution provides a lot of its own excellent analysis of these data, it offers no facility to help users manipulate and chart the data themselves. You can of course download one of the national accounts tables and analyze the numbers on your own, using a spreadsheet or some other software, but this can be cumbersome and time-consuming.<br><br>

This browser allows you to explore the national accounts data easily, from a number of angles. It works best if you have a moderately large computer screen, but it also works fine on a laptop. The app even works tolerably on an iPhone. It transforms the basic data by calculating percentage changes, ratios to GDP and other analytical manipulations. It also helps visualize changes in the statistics through time, by means of graphical representations. And it allows you to analyze the corresponding annual statistics, using the same transformation and charting capabilities.<br><br>

Statistics Canada provides the quarterly national accounts in online tables, including both ones that are regularly updated and ones that are archived historical tables. This browser deals with fifty-four of the currently updated quarterly tables from this large database and three of the archived historical ones. Each table and chart displayed contains a footnote reference to the corresponding Statistics Canada online data table from which it is derived.<br><br>

You are presently reading from the 'Introduction and explanation' tab. There are four other clickable tabs labelled 'List of tables', 'Quarterly statistics', 'Annual statistics' and 'Selections'. It is straightforward to use these tabs.<br>

<h2 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>The 'List of tables' tab</strong></h2>
<h3 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> The 'List of tables' tab shows the scope of this browser by listing all the available tables. The same list can be found in the 'Quarterly statistics' and 'Annual statistics' tabs when you click in the 'Choose a table:' box. The list also gives the time range covered by each table.<br>

<h2 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>The 'Quarterly statistics' tab</strong></h2>
<h3 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> The 'Quarterly statistics' tab presents the basic statistics in tabular form, for any one of the tables in the list, and also allows you to draw a chart for any line in any of the tables. There are two sub-tabs, one to display tables and the other to draw charts. The time range for a table or a chart is selectable. Choices are also offered among six possible transformations of the data which are:<br><br>
- Original table (no transformation),<br>
- Indexed, starting quarter = 100,<br>
- One-quarter percentage change,<br>
- Four-quarter percentage change,<br>
- Percentage of gross domestic product at market prices,<br>
- Five-quarter centred moving average<br><br>
The "Percentage of gross domestic product at market prices" transformation is available for all tables that do not contain price or volume index numbers. It provides a way to explore the magnitude of different series relative to the GDP yardstick.<br><br>

You may notice that in some tables, some of the line captions have a number or letter in brackets at the end, such as "Households (2)". This is not a footnote reference. Rather, it is a number inserted to distinguish between table rows that contain different statistics, but would otherwise have the same line caption. Thus, for example, in the "Current and capital accounts, National" table, "Households (1)" refers to the part of the national balance of primary incomes that pertains to households, while "Households (2)" refers to the part of national disposable income that pertains to households. In the financial flows and national balance sheet tables the symbols (A) and (L), for "assets" and "liabilities", are used instead of (1) and (2).<br><br>

There is a button on the right, above the display, that can be used to download the table or chart. The downloaded '.csv' or '.png' file contains the data you see on the screen, covering the time range displayed, and if you choose one of the transformations, the downloaded data will have that transformation.<br><br>

Note that occasionally, when charting a time series from one of the tables, Statistics Canada provides data for a shorter time range for certain time series than it does for other series in the table. This explains why the time range in charts for some time series may be shorter than expected. In the corresponding table there will be NAs for these missing numbers.<br><br>

There is also a box allowing you to specify, at your option, a different title for a chart. This option is provided because the default chart title is the Statistics Canada line caption for the chosen line in the table. For one reason or another, if you want to download the chart you might prefer to specify a different title.<br>

<h2 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>The 'Annual statistics' tab</strong></h2>
<h3 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> The 'Annual statistics' tab has functions identical to the 'Quarterly statistics' tab, except that they are applied to the corresponding annual data. The browser creates the annual data by time-aggregating the quarterly data. When doing so, it drops years for which not all four of the quarters are available, or in the case of tables with stock- rather than flow-type data it drops years that do not include a fourth quarter (end of year) value.

<h2 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>The 'Selections' tab</strong></h2>
<h3 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> The 'Selections' tab offers a set of forty-two charts. These static charts illustrate a few of the interesting growth patterns you can discover by exploring the tables, choosing a line in a table, applying one of the transformations, selecting an appropriate time range and displaying the results in graphical form.<br>

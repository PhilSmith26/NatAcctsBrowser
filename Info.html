<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>Canadian National Accounts Browser</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> This is a Canadian national accounts browser. It presents the main tables of Canada's quarterly national accounts. It works best if you have a moderately large computer screen.<br><br>
Statistics Canada makes the national accounts data available free, online, to anyone who wants to see them. So what is the need for this browser? The need arises because Statistics Canada's online data tables contain only the basic statistics. They provide no facility to transform the data in ways that make them more analytically digestible. You can of course download one of these tables and analyze the numbers yourself, using appropriate software, but this can be cumbersome and time-consuming. <br><br>
This browser allows you to explore the national accounts data easily, from a number of different angles. It does this partly through transformations of the basic data, such as percentage changes and shares of the total. It also helps visualize changes in the statistics through time, by means of graphical representations.<br><br>
Statistics Canada provides the quarterly national accounts in online tables, including both ones that are regularly updated and archived historical tables that are not. This browser deals with twenty of the currently updated tables from this large database. The tables included are:<br><br>
1. Gross domestic product, income-based<br>
2. Gross domestic product, expenditure-based, at current prices<br>
3. Gross domestic product, expenditure-based, at constant chained Fisher prices<br>
4. Gross domestic product price indexes<br>
5. Gross domestic income, gross national income and net national income<br>
6. Current and capital accounts, national<br>
7. Detailed household final consumption expenditure<br>
8. Detailed household final consumption expenditure, 2012 constant prices<br>
9. Gross domestic product by industry, chained Fisher, part 1<br>
10. Gross domestic product by industry, chained Fisher, part 2<br>
11. Gross domestic product by industry, chained Fisher, part 3<br>
12. Balance of international payments, current and capital accounts<br>
13. Gross fixed capital formation<br>
14. Gross fixed capital formation, chained Fisher<br>
15. Revenue, expenditure and budgetary balance - general governments<br>
16. Revenue, expenditure and budgetary balance - federal government<br>
17. Revenue, expenditure and budgetary balance - provincial governments<br>
18. Compensation of employees<br>
19. Undistributed corporate profits<br>
20. Property income of households<br><br>

You are presently reading from the 'Introduction and explanation' tab. There are two other tabs labelled 'Tables' and 'Charts'. You click them to gain access to their functions. It is straightforward to use these tabs, although a brief explanation follows.<br>
<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>The 'Tables' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> The 'Tables' tab presents the statistics in tabular form, for each of the above tables. The time range to be displayed is selectable. You can choose any of the tables listed above by clicking in the 'Choose a table' box. Choices are also offered among five possible transformations of the data which are:<br><br>
- Original table (no transformation),<br>
- Indexed, starting quarter = 100<br>
- One-quarter percentage change,<br>
- Four-quarter percentage change and<br>
- Percentage of gross domestic product at market prices<br><br>
The "Percentage of gross domestic product at market prices" transformation is available for all tables that do not contain price or volume index numbers. It provides a way to explore the magnitude of different series relative to the GDP yardstick. However, note that it does not always mean "share" since the elements in some tables are not components of gross domestic product. For example, this applies to transfer payments in the revenue, expenditure and budgetary balance tables. In some cases, this transformation may not be applicable, in which case you are informed and no table is displayed. This applies to index number tables, where percentages of gross domestic product are not meaningful.<br><br>
You may notice that in some tables, some of the line captions have a number in brackets at the end, such as "Households (2)". This is not a footnote reference. Rather, it is a number inserted to distinguish, within the program, between table rows that contain different statistics, but would otherwise have the same line caption. Thus, for example, in the "Current and capital accounts, national" table, "Households (1)" refers to the part of the national balance of primary incomes that pertains to households, while "Households (2)" refers to the part of national disposable income that pertains to households.<br>
<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>The 'Charts' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> The 'Charts' tab allows you to draw a chart for any one of the time series that are shown in the tables. The time range to be displayed in the chart is selectable.<br><br>
As in the 'Tables' tab, you begin by clicking in the 'Choose a table' box to select a table. Then you click in the 'Choose a time series to chart' box to select a time series in that table. The third step is to pick a transformation, just as in the 'Tables' tab. Finally, you can select any starting quarter for the chart between the first available quarter and the latest quarter. Note that while most tables are available from the first quarter of 1961 to date, the two tables for detailed household final consumption expenditure and the balance of international payments table are only available from the first quarter of 1981 and the three gross domestic product by industry tables from the first quarter of 1997.<br><br>
Again, as in the 'Tables' tab, there are situations where one of the transformations is not applicable, in which case you are informed and no chart is displayed.<br>

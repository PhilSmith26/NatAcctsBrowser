# NatAcctsBrowser

This R/shiny app allows the user to browse through Canada's quarterly national accounts tables. It presents 57 tables and allows the user to view them either "as is" or with transformations, over any available time range. It also allows the user to draw charts for any lines in any of the tables, again with any one of the available transformations and over any time range. The transformations are (1) indexed to 100 at the start, (2) one-quarter % changes, (3) four-quarter % changes, (4) % of GDP and (5) same as (1) but including a trend line. The application also allows the user to download the tables, transformed or not, over any time range that is available, as .csv files and to download charts as .png files.
